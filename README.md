# About Me
I am a dedicated CS-IT student with a diverse skill set, delving into the realms of Full Stack Development and Embedded Programming. As an enthusiastic learner, I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to broaden my horizons and refine my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology. Efficiency is a guiding principle in my work, as I strive to optimize processes and deliver high-quality results in a timely manner.\

Despite my coding prowess, I'll admit that colors and graphical design aren't my strong suit ðŸŽ¨, but I make up for it with my dedication, independence, and a thirst for gaining new knowledge and experiences. Currently, I'm in the exciting phase of writing my thesis as I approach the end of my studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Informatics in Maribor.
